# SmileBar-Website
SmileBar is a dental clinic website.The user can make an appointment online,can contact the clinic,leave a review,see some pictures and about information for the clinic.

Features:
Firstly with the Nav bar(CSS, bootstrap and fontawesome). We made a menu that consists of the Home,Services,About,Make appointment, Reviews, Contact and Log in.They all have a location that sends user on the page. When user logs in, the nav bar's Log in changes into Profile and than when the admin logs in, this shows as Admin and sends the user to the admin page. Another section is About us and it shows some pictures and general information about the clinic.
Next is Our services section that shows the services that were entered into the database by admin.
The next section is Work Process(html and CSS) which explains some work processes of the clinic.
Next comes the review setion. Here the reviews of users that admin approves will show.Users can give stars to the review from 1-5.
Than comes the most important section:make appointment section. Here the user can complete and submit the form with the neccessary information.
The footerdisplays information about the dental clinic(made with bootstrap and fontawesome.
We also have the log in and registration pages which are forms that the user completes. User can regist and log in.The name for the registration should be unique.
